# NBA-Salary-Group-Project-in-R
Analyzing the success of NBA teams based on the salaries of their players

This was a group project I participated in where we built a website where you can view the effect of different salaries on a team's ELO which is a stat created by 538 that essentially tells you how good a team is or was.
